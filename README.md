## About The Project

This page is a kind of compilation of the episodes of the anime podcast Trash Taste, I made it as a practice with React and libraries like MUI and TailwindCSS. It also allowed me to work with REST APIs and how to handle them in production. 

There is still a lot I want to implement but for now this is the first version of the page.
